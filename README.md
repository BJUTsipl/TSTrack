# TSTrack

Single-object tracking is a fundamental enabling
 technology in the field of remote sensing observation. It plays
 a crucial role in tasks such as unmanned aerial vehicle route
 surveillance and maritime vessel trajectory prediction. However,
 because of challenges such as the weak discriminative power
 of target features, interference from complex environments, and
 frequent viewpoint changes, existing trackers often suffer from
 insufficient temporal modeling capabilities and low computa
tional efficiency, which limit their practical deployment. To
 address these challenges, we propose TSTrack, a novel lightweight
 single-object tracking framework that integrates Transformer
 and Mamba-based spatiotemporal modeling. First, we propose
 the target-aware feature purification preprocessor (TAFPP) ,
 designed to dynamically enhance target representation through
 a synergistic combination of the dynamic position acuity module
 (DPAM) and spectral channel recalibrator (SCR). Second, we
 introduce the recurrent Mamba interaction pyramid (RM-IP)
 to replace traditional recurrent neural network-based struc
tures, leveraging a state-space model for efficient and expressive
 temporal modeling with significantly reduced parameter over
head. Finally, we propose the elastic reconstructive multi-scale
 fusion (ERMSF) module, which adopts a four-branch parallel
 architecture to achieve effective multiscale feature fusion and
 dynamic shape adaptation, thereby enhancing robustness against
 target deformations and scale variations. Extensive experiments
 conducted on benchmark datasets, including LaSOT, Track
ingNet, and GOT-10k, demonstrate the effectiveness of TSTrack.
 The results show that TSTrack achieves a superior tracking
 accuracy while maintaining a lightweight design, significantly
 outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.
